# Guestbook-EJS

This server is a little more advanced to demonstrate how EJS can be used to power a website. This example comes from "Express in Action" from O'Reilly Press.

This program uses the packages `morgan` and `body-parser`. 

**Body-Parser** can parse the body of POST requiests, and **morgan** is used for logging. Another library used in this project is **bootstrap** which is a CSS library that allows for a nicer looking html interface.
